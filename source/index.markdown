*The mission of the autonomous networks research group 
is to perform high-impact academic research in the area of wireless and mobile networks.*


We're interested in a broad spectrum of research into wireless and mobile networks, from deep theory and mathematical analysis to real-world experiments and applications.

Some of our ongoing research interests include novel economic market-based design of protocols for routing and rate-control, multi-hop cooperative diversity techniques, artificial intelligence and game theoretic approaches for medium access in cognitive radio networks, and the design and analysis of mobile social networking applications.


Many of our key results in recent years have pertained to the design and analysis of algorithms for next-generation wireless sensor networks. These networks are envisioned to be unattended systems with applications ranging from environmental sensing, structural monitoring, and industrial process control to emergency response and mobile target tracking.


We also work on vehicular networks, green cellular networks, 
underwater acoustic networks, cognitive radio networks, and mobile social networks.
